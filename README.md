# programcomp
A variety of programs I have made. This is more of a learning expierence than something practical to use.

# Future Plans:
-------------
- A few simple games (maybe hangman or noughts and crosses).
- A better version of Text Editor that doesn't put everything on one line or can start a new line without exiting the editor.
